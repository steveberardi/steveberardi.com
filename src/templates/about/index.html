    <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Steve Berardi, a software engineer that lives in a suburb of San Diego, California. This is my personal website where I showcase some of my side-projects.</p>
    
    <p>I've had many passions in life, and when I get really passionate about something I usually start some kind of <a href="/projects/">project</a> around it. For a long time my biggest passion was <a href="/photos/">nature photography</a>, but in the last few years I've been more into astronomy (and especially creating maps of the sky).</p>
