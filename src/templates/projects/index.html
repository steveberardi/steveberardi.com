    <p>PhotoNaturalist is a blog on nature photography that I started in 2009. Every week or so, I publish a new article about how to improve your nature photos. I cover all types of nature photography: landscapes, close-up, and wildlife. I also send out a weekly email newsletter with links to other great photography articles I come across.</p>
